What is AlgoTrade?

AlgoTrade is a online simulator of some investment strategies developed in
Python. It uses Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and yfinance libraries.

The simulator is still in development and users should note that even if fully completed, it should not be used as a prediction tool, as neither past nor simulated data guarantee future results. Tools like this should be used for educational purposes only and under no circumstances should they be used for the purpose of making real-world investment decisions.

To use the application, you have to go to [https://algotrade.irreverente.net](https://algotrade.irreverente.net).
